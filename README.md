# Sort Lines By Line Length

You ever feel like your files look like you copy/paste too often?
Your pull requests getting rejected a little too often?

Make your spaghetti code look like it was caerefully thought through!

All you need to do:

1. Highlight lines.
2. Press `Shift+CMD+z` (macOS) / `ctrl+alt+z` (windows).
3. Take 30min break.

## Features

Can sort all of your unnesisary imports/exports. You use a scripting language? It'll sort every copy/paste line of code you can managee to highlight with your overpriced mouse.

## Release Notes

Added ability to sort your lines by line length. Added inituitive ability to change polarity of sorting when user triggers sort on the same highlighted text, more than once. Added ability to save ~3min by using keyboard shortcut to trigger sorting.
